        
        PLAN - OF - ACTION 

1) IMPORT THE MODEL - RESNET MODEL - FROM KERAS

<!-- from keras_applications.resnet import ResNet50 -->
OR
<!-- from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50 -->


ResNet - 

The ResNet model was proposed in Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun.


WHY ARE WE USING RESNET, INSTEAD OF TRAINING OUR OWN CNN MODEL 



2) EXTRACT FEATURES  - OF GIVEN IMG - USING RESNET - [2048 FEATURE - VECTOR]




3) EXPORT FEATURES - SAVE FEATURES 

[44K , 2048] - MATRIX - (44K IMG IN DATASET)

- pickle.dump(feature-list)
- pickle.dump(filenames) -why needed ??
- 

4) FIND 5 CLOSEST NIEGHBOUR - USE NEAREST NEIGHBOUR - scikit

<!-- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html -->

>>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
