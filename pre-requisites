        PRE-REQUISITES 


1) DEEP LEARNING - CNN
convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet)

What is CNN in deep learning?


A CNN is a kind of network architecture for deep learning algorithms
 and is specifically used for image recognition and tasks that involve 
 the processing of pixel data. 
 
 There are other types of neural networks in 
 deep learning, but for identifying and recognizing objects,
 
 CNNs are the network architecture of choice.

 What are the 4 types of CNN?
CNN Architectures, a Deep-dive
VGG Net.
ResNet.
Dense Net.
Inception Net.
Xception Net.



2) TRANSFER LEARNING

Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) 
that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 

For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks.

What is transfer learning in CNN?

The basic premise of transfer learning is simple: take a model trained on a large dataset and transfer its knowledge to a smaller dataset. For object recognition with a CNN, we freeze the early convolutional layers of the network and only train the last few layers which make a prediction.


WE ARE USING RESNET 

What Is Residual Neural Network (ResNet)? 

Residual Network (ResNet) is a deep learning model used for computer vision applications. 
It is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to support hundreds or thousands of convolutional layers.
